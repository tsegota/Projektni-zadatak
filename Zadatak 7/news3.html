			<h2>Smartphone buyer's guide</h2>
			<p class="description">Decisions, decisions, decisions. The holiday season is upon us and 'tis the season of joy and happiness. But it could also be one of the most stressful events each year because them presents won't buy themselves, will they? That's why we decided to pitch in and hopefully make some of those decisions easier for you.</p>
			<p>This 2018 was a fruitful year when it comes to smartphones and there were times when we raced against time to bring those on-time reviews for you. Because we know how important this information for the early adopters is, those who preorder and get some extra goodies, but also risks that come with the territory.</p>
			<p>And now we are ready to give you that cheat sheet you need for this smartphone shopping season. We boiled a whole year of work down to a few pages for you. How about that?!</p>
			<p>For the past smartphone guides we used to divide the phones into price brackets, but for this one we decided to try something different. We'll focus on one feature on each page and list the best phones in this category prices low to high. This way you can easily jump on photography or gaming and see what the best phones at each of those categories are.</p>
			<p>Every now and then a person just needs a phone for making calls, and all other features come second. The handsets evolved so rapidly, though, that the regular (dumb) phones didn't have time to really catch up and find their place.</p>
			<p>But there are quite a few offers from different makers, which won't overcomplicate your life and will allow you to stay in touch with family, friends, and colleagues without making you go crazy with laggy performance.</p>
